# My STL Implementation

This repository contains my custom implementations of various STL (Standard Template Library) data structures in C++.

The goal of this repo is to deepen understanding of STL internals and C++ concepts by manually implementing common containers such as vectors, linked lists, maps, and hash tables.

This hands-on approach is designed to prepare for technical interviews, focusing on low-level memory management, iterator design, copy/move semantics, and performance optimizations.
